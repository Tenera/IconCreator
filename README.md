# IconCreator

Small and simple tool to create icon files.

From any square image of at least 256 by 256 pixels, the application can create:

* an icon file (*.ico) containing the image in sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128 and 256x256)

* or a favicon.ico containing the image in format 16x16



This is what the UI looks like:
